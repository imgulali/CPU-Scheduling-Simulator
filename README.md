# CPU Scheduling Visualizer

This project is a web-based visualizer for CPU scheduling algorithms. It uses a JavaScript frontend for visualization and allows for easy implementation of scheduling logic.

## Documentation

We have detailed documentation available for developers:

- **[Project Integration Guide](docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)**: Start here. Explains how the Logic layer interacts with the UI.
- **[Logic Development Guide](docs/LOGIC_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)**: Specific instructions for C++ developers on how to write algorithms in JavaScript for this project.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Select an algorithm and enter process details.
3. Click "Run" to see the visualization.
